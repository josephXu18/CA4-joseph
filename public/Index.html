        <h2>Designing this page</h2>
        <p class="post-date">Edited on: October 20, 2024</p>
        <p class="post-excerpt">I built this site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, with Node.js and Socket.io for the backend functionality. The structure is crafted with HTML, while CSS provides styling for a clean, professional look. I used JavaScript to add interactivity, such as a chat room feature, where I implemented real-time messaging with Socket.io to enable user connections, display active users, and manage typing notifications. Node.js serves as the server, handling requests and storing message history so new users can see past conversations.</p>

        <h2>Learning path</h2>
        <p class="post-date">Edited on: October 25, 2024</p>
        <p class="post-excerpt">Building this site has deepened my understanding of both front-end and back-end development. I gained hands-on experience with HTML and CSS for structuring and styling, making the design clean and user-friendly. Implementing JavaScript allowed me to add interactive features, while using Node.js and Socket.io taught me how to handle real-time communication and manage server-client relationships effectively. I also learned about managing user states, such as displaying active users and tracking typing status, which helped me think more critically about user experience. Overall, this project enhanced my problem-solving skills and gave me confidence in developing dynamic, responsive web applications.</p>
